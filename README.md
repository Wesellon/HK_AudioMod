# Hollow Knight Audio Guide Mod

A lightweight mod for Hollow Knight that adds auditory cues to help you:

- **Locate bosses on the map** by playing a unique sound when you hover over each boss, helping navigation.  
- **Navigate the Delicate Flower quest** using sound cues slightly guiding the player.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Wesellon/HK_AudioMod/releases).  
2. Extract the ZIP.  
3. Copy the entire `HK_AudioMod` folder into your Hollow Knight `Mods` directory (typically `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Hollow Knight\Mods`).  
4. Launch the game

## Usage

- **Map Boss Cues**  
  Open your map and hover the waypoint marker cursor over known boss locations to hear distinct audio cues.  
- **Delicate Flower Guidance**  
  During the Delicate Flower quest, hover the waypoint marker cursor over area exits to know where to go.
